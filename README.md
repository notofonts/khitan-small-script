## Design

Noto Khitan Small Script is designed based on the purpose of text use, using a more writing-oriented FangSong style font, easy to read and more compatible with the typeface of the text.

The font is designed by LIU Zhao and ZHANG Congyu, and the OpenType layout is designed by Kushim JIANG.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://notofonts.github.io/khitan-small-script.

For information on how to work on Noto fonts, how the build process
works and how to maintain it, see [the README file of the
notofonts.github.io
repository](https://github.com/notofonts/notofonts.github.io/blob/main/README.md)
